# JAUS - Job Application Update Services [Group Project for VT Hacks 7]
A project that was intended to keep track of user job applications and their statuses and storing them into a spreadsheet on an android app.
One part of the project was supposed to be a Chrome Extension extracting job application emails from the users gmail account. The other part was supposed to be an app that stored the job applications and their statuses. We had a 36 hour time-frame, so unfortunately, we were unable to complete it. 

# How it works
- Running the Python code:
Run the ReadEmail1test.ipynb file after updating your credentials (as of right now only works statically, so one user at a time). The python code will parse the data from your Gmail and retrieve all job application related emails. 
- Viewing the Web Application:
Click the index.html file while all the files are within your directory or click this link: https://majorsalad.github.io/Job-Application-Update-Services/

- Was introduced to Python for the first time and got accustomed to the basics
- Strengthened my use of Regex and realized how powerful regex patterns can be
- Designed a fully-functioning web app
- My graphic designing skills improved as I was able to create a web app logo with photo-editing skills
- Learned how to work in a team and how to pace myself
